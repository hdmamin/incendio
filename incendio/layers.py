        n_hashes: int
            This determines the number of hashes that will be taken
            for each word index, and as a result, the number of rows
            that will be summed to create each unique representation.
            The higher the number, the lower the chances of a collision.
        padding_idx: int or None
            If an integer is provided, this will set aside the corresponding
            row in the embedding matrix as a vector of zeros. If None, no
            padding vector will be allocated.
        pre_hashed: bool
            Pass in True if the input tensor will already be hashed by the
            time it enters this layer (you may prefer pre-compute the hashes
            in the Dataset to save computation time during training). In this
            scenario, the layer is a simple embedding bag with mode "sum".
            Pass in False if the inputs will be word indices that have not yet
            been hashed. In this case, hashing will be done inside the
            `forward` call.
